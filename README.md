IEC 61499 function block library for building forecast based energy system control applications.
​
# Requires
* Any IEC 61499 compliant tool
* Full list of tools: http://www.iec61499.de/tools.htm
* The 4diac function block library: https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/en_lib.php

# Installation in 4diac
* https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/
* Create a new project in 4diac-IDE and copy the subdirectories into the workkspace, i.e.
  4DIAC-IDE 1.8.4\workspace\PVTController\PVTControllerLib
* Export the function blocks to the FORTE modules folder (see 4diac documentation: https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/documentation/html/4diacIDE/createOwnTypes.html#exportTypes)
* To use the SIFBs, extract the .h and .cpp files from SIFB_source.zip into the respective modules.
* Add the modules to CMake and also add the following modules:
  FORTE_MODULE_Convert, FORTE_MODULE_Events, FORTE_MODULE_Functional, FORTE_MODULE_IEC61131, FORTE_MODULE_RT_Events, FORTE_MODULE_UTILS, FORTE_MODULE_Utils,
  FORTE_COM_FBDK (optional)
  (see: https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/documentation/html/installation/install.html#ownFORTE)
* Build FORTE
* The project includes various applications that can be extracted from the Applications.zip file and copied to the project's root directory.
​* Alternatively, the Windows binary "forte.exe" and the Posix binary "forte" can be used on Windows and Linux distributions.
  In this case, no exporting or deployment is necessary.

# Documentation
The library was created using 4diac.
A detailed documentation of the project is available at: http://pvspeicher.htw-berlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Jakobi-2017-Development-of-model-based-control-applications-compliant-with-IEC-61499.pdf

# Side notes
* To use the FortePVForecaster and ForteLoadForecaster SIFBs instead of the regular PVForecaster and LoadForecaster BFBs, the exported PVForecaster and LoadForecaster source files have to be changed.
  The private methods and properties have to be changed to protected and the alg_initialize() and alg_updateMemory() methods have to be made virtual.
* The Posix_Utils module will only run on a Posix system (i.e. Raspberry Pi). Attempting to build it on a Win32 system will result in compiler errors.
